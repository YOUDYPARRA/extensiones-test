# Privacy Policy (effective Jun 26, 2020)
In short, this extension does *not* transfer, track or share any student, user or usage information.  

The extension does leverage the [Chrome 'sync'](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage') Services.  In short, this means that if 'sync' is enabled, your class lists will be available on all devices where you are signed in.  If sync is not enabled, class lists  will function as previously with the [LocalStorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage#localStorage) functionality.  All of the 'sync'ing between devices is completed using Google's standard API calls (over HTTPS).  As before, your class lists are <u>never</u> saved to external servers. 

The source code for this extension is provided to verify this policy - see [Licence](LICENSE.md).

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  When a change is needed, a prominent notice will be shown in the extension's Attendance dialog and this page will be updated.  You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
